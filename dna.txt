to create a test lifeform -> start with:
1) Initial number of chromosomes
2) Initial base pairs per chromosome

Need to choose asexual or sexual reproduction...

Perhaps start with the string:
"AGTAC"...

Splits off into two cells.  Theoretically the same.
There's a chance of adding a gene.
Adding a chromosome.
Changing the genes inside.

So how would one do this?

Have a chromosome object for the animal.

Organism has _n_ chromosomes.
Chromosomes have _m_ base pairs.

There is a chance for each to mutate during cellular reproduction.  For _n_ chromosomes, there is a _p_ probability per chromosome to mutate.
For _m_ base pairs, _q_ probability per base pair.

Population object has so many organism objects.
